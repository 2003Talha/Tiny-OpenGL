# Tiny-OpenGL

A small OpenGL learning project inspired by [The Cherno's Sparky Engine tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject).  
This is not a production-ready engine â€” itâ€™s part of my journey into learning **graphics programming** and **game engine architecture**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Practice **C++** with modern development tools (Visual Studio 2022).
- Understand the basics of **OpenGL rendering**.
- Learn about **shaders, buffers, and rendering pipelines**.
- Gain experience with project structure and using **Git/GitHub**.

---

## âœ¨ Features Implemented
- Window creation with **GLFW**.
- OpenGL context setup with **GLEW**.
- Basic **shader system** (vertex + fragment shaders).
- Simple **2D renderer** (sprites, static & dynamic).
- Basic **math library** (vectors, matrices).

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (or compatible C++ compiler).
- OpenGL-capable environment.
- Dependencies (already included in `Dependencies/`):
  - [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
  - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2003Talha/Tiny-OpenGL.git
