# Learning Engine (Cherno Sparky Tutorial)

This is my **learning project** while following [The Cherno's Sparky Engine series](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject).

## What I Learned
- Setting up a Visual Studio 2022 C++ project
- Linking external libraries (GLEW, GLFW)
- Basics of OpenGL rendering
- Engine structure (window, shaders, rendering, math utilities)

⚠️ Note: This is **not an original engine**, but my practice project for learning.
